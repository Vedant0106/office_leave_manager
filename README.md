In this project, we are building a leave management application. In this project, there are login panels-one for both employee and for both admin and employee. In the employee panel, we can apply for the leave as well as view the records of all the previous applied leaves whereas in the admin’s panel we can view those leave requests applied by the employees and approve or reject those requests. We can also view details of the employees as well as add new employees to the list. We can simply transition from employee’s panel to admin’s panel and vice versa simply by logging out of the former panel and logging in with the id and password of the latter panel.
